# Title: Spotify Palate 

## What and Why : 

Spotify Palate (tentative name) is a web application that analyzes a user's Spotify music taste and listening habits. It organizes and compiles a user's top artists, top tracks, as well as the genre and mood of the music that the user often listens to. It then offers an option to present that information for the timespan of: past month, past 6 months, and all time. Although Spotify offers some ways for its users to look back at their own music taste through an annual Spotify "wrapped" and displaying top tracks of the month on a user's profile page, their options are respectively limited in ways that it can be browsed only at the end of year, and it only analyzes music during the past month. Spotify Palate intends to fill this gap by allowing users to browse and analyze their music taste whenever they want, and providing a bigger picture by offering analytics of listening history of various time spans. 


## For Whom? :

Spotify Palate is for any Spotify user who would like to analyze their own music taste.

## How?:

1. Greet the user with a landing page that contains a button to log in with their Spotify.
2. Upon login, present the analyzed music taste to the user. The user should have options to browse through:
    - Music mood for the past month
    - Music mood for the past 6 months
    - Music mood for all time
    - Top artists for the past month
    - Top artists for the past 6 months
    - Top artists for all time
    - Top tracks for the past month
    - Top tracks for the past 6 months
    - Top tracks for all time 
    - Top genres for the past month
    - Top genres for the past 6 months
    - Top genres for all time

## Scope: 

In order to make sure that this project is neither too easy nor too ambitious to be completed by 4-6 programmers in a semester, there can be steps for the team to take for either scenarios.

Too easy:
- Implement more analytic features.
- Implement a music recommendation system that the user may enjoy based on the user's music palate.
- Explore ways to aesthetically deliver the analyzed results in a less boring manner (i.e. on a receipt or a transcript template).

Too ambitious:
- Strip down web app front-end to be as minimal/bare-bones as possible.
- Strip away the music mood analytics option which may be the hardest one to implement out of the listed options.
