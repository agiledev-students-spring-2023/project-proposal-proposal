# Title: Always there to help 

## What and Why ##: 

I would like to build a communication or chatting resource app for students(High school, Undergraduate, Graduate, etc.) in need of late night support whether it is academic or emotional. Students tend to have lots on their plates and will struggle for many reasons, but most struggles come down to mental health, emotional burden, or an academic task. These tasks tend to have a huge toll on students. Therefore, with this app, students can always have someone to talk to in case they need the emotional support. Or in case they are doing homeowkr, studying late night for an exam and still do not have answers to the questions they need, they can always find someone at any time of the day to help them. 

## For Whom? ##:

This software is for students from anywhere to High School to Graduate School. These times are when emotional and/or academic support matter the most. As a student myself, I have had times where I felt very stressed the night before the exam, the time waiting for my results, or the bitterness of seeing a bad grade. There are also times where I still do not understand everything before the actual exam. Therefore, my app will be able to connect people with all of these resources. Stressed, get a professional therapist to help. Sad because of an unsatisfactory grade, talk to an emotional support specialist. Need help on a test/quiz, talk to a tutor in the subject. No matter what time of day it is, there will always be someone to help.
