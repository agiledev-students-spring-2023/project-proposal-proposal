# Title: Always there to help 

# What and Why: 

I would like to build a communication or chatting resource app for students(High school, Undergraduate, Graduate, etc.) in need of late night support whether it is academic or emotional. Students tend to have lots on their plates and will struggle for many reasons, but most struggles come down to mental health, emotional burden, or an academic task. These tasks tend to have a huge toll on students. Therefore, with this app, students can always have someone to talk to in case they need the emotional support. Or in case they are doing homeowkr, studying late night for an exam and still do not have answers to the questions they need, they can always find someone at any time of the day to help them.
